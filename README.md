# webpack-es2015-sass-setup

Sample webpack project with ES2015 and Sass.

!! !! no webpack dev server -- using laravel valet for local dev server. !! !!

This is a basic setup that only includes two main app files for demo purposes: `./src/js/app.js` and `./src/scss/main.scss`. You get the idea.

There's nothing in this setup that hasn't been done earlier by other people (see credits section for more advanced configuration).
This project might be useful when quick (local) development setup is needed, to play with new stuff.

## Environment setup

```sh
  $ npm install
```

## Bundling

```sh
  $ npm run bundle
  // OR
  $ npm run prod
  // OR
  $ npm run production
```

## Watch Assets
